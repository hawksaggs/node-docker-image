# node-docker-image
Basic node application with docker images file

Make sure you have docker install and running on your system.

# Build docker image
$ docker build -t <your username>/node-web-app .

# Run the image

Running your image with -d runs the container in detached mode, leaving the container running in the background. The -p flag redirects a public port to a private port inside the container. Run the image you previously built:

$ docker run -p 49160:8080 -d <your username>/node-web-app
  
# Test

To test your app, get the port of your app that Docker mapped:

$ docker ps

# Example
ID            IMAGE                                COMMAND    ...   PORTS
ecce33b30ebf  <your username>/node-web-app:latest  npm start  ...   49160->8080
  
# OUTPUT 
$ curl -i localhost:49160
